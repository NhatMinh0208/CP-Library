<h1 id="normie-s-competitive-programming-library">Normie&#39;s Competitive Programming Library</h1>
<p>This place is where I store templates for many different data structures and algorithms I used throughout my competitive programming career.</p>
<p>There&#39;s still a lot of stuff to add, but you can already find some useful templates of DSAs here.</p>
<p>I hope this helps people in their CP journey.</p>
<p>(Note that I won&#39;t be around to update the library very often, since I&#39;m still training for APIO and IOI.)</p>
<h1 id="todo-">Todo:</h1>
<p>Add basic stuff</p>
<p>Add documentation. Some simpler DSAs haven&#39;t been documented.</p>
