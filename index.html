<h1 style="color:white;background-color: brown; text-align: center;" id="normie-s-competitive-programming-library">Normie&#39;s Competitive Programming Library</h1>
<p>This place is where I store templates for many different data structures and algorithms I used throughout my competitive programming career.</p>
<p>There&#39;s still a lot of stuff to add, but you can already find some useful templates of <abbr title="data structures and algorithms">DSAs</abbr> here.</p>
<p>I hope this helps people in their <abbr title="competitive programming">CP</abbr> journey.</p>
<h3 id="todo-">Todo:</h3>
<p>Add basic stuff. For the time being, this library serves more to help me in my contests. I hope to improve it to make it more accessible for newcomers soon.</p>
<p>Add documentation. Some simpler DSAs haven&#39;t been documented.</p>
<p>Fix max segtree with search so that search operation is O(n*log<sub>2</sub>n).</p>
<p>Test more operations of treap.</p>
