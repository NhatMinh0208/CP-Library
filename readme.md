# Normie's Competitive Programming Library
This place is where I store templates for many different data structures and algorithms I used throughout my competitive programming career.

There's still a lot of stuff to add, but you can already find some useful templates of DSAs here.

I hope this helps people in their CP journey.

(Note that I won't be around to update the library very often, since I'm still training for APIO and IOI.)
# Todo:
Add basic stuff

Add documentation. Some simpler DSAs haven't been documented.
