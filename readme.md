# Normie's Competitive Programming Library
This place is where I store templates for many different data structures and algorithms I used throughout my competitive programming career.

Currently it's in a very raw state. Many templates have no comments, making them hard to read and use, and the files are not catergorized yet.

Hopefully I can clean it up soon.
