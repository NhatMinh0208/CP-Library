# Normie's Competitive Programming Library
This place is where I store templates for many different data structures and algorithms I used throughout my competitive programming career.

There's still a lot of stuff to add, but you can already find some useful templates of DSAs here.

I hope this helps people in their CP journey.
## Todo:
Add basic stuff. For the time being, this library serves more to help me in my contests. I hope to improve it to make it more accessible for
newcomers soon.

Add documentation. Some simpler DSAs haven't been documented.
